# makocode
A simple standard for barcode printing with maximal density, maximal resiliency, and slow eventual decoding. Designed for paper or film. Self-contained clean-room implementation with no dependencies for future-proofing. Stubborn and dense as a Shiba, with no fluff. Lovingly named after my Shiba Inu dog, Mako.
