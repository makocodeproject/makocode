# MakoCode🐾
A standard for color barcode printing with maximal density, maximal resiliency,
and slow eventual decoding. Designed for paper or film. Self-contained
clean-room implementation with dependencies included for future-proofing.
Stubborn and dense as a Shiba, with no fluff. Lovingly named after my Shiba
Inu, Mako 🐕.

Currently, this project is just a specification draft with no working implementation.

# Build/Test
