# MakoCode🐾
A simple standard for color barcode printing with maximal density, maximal resiliency, and slow eventual decoding. Designed for paper or film. Self-contained clean-room implementation with dependencies included for future-proofing. Stubborn and dense as a Shiba, with no fluff. Lovingly named after my Shiba Inu dog, Mako 🐕.

Currently this project is just a specification draft with no implementation.

# Build/Test

    cmake .
    make
